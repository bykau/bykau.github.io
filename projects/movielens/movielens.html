<h2>Project Description</h2>
Recommender systems predict items a user is likely to like using
historical data about users and items. A key challenge is how to
provide recommendations when historical data is sparse or missing,
known as the cold-start problem. Current solutions to this problem
assume that given an item and a user, the recommendation process
misses historical data only about one of them but not both. In this
paper, we are interested in the challenging more severe form of the
cold-start problem of new-user/new-item. In particular, we are interested
in cases where a system collects historical data about users
and items but produces recommendations mostly for new or anonymous
users and about new or evolved items. We present methods
that can be used to deal with this problem, study them and present
our experimental findings
