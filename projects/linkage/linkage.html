<h1>Contextual Linkage</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
Wikipedia history dump (7TB)

<h2>Technologies & Algorithms</h2> 
python, correlation clustering, crowdsourcing

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Nowadays Web sources provide information in both structured and
unstructured forms, e.g., a product page contains a table with the
summary of product specs whereas the textual part contains a detailed description and reviews, a Wikipedia page contains both text
and an infobox, and so on. We focus on the problem of contextual
linkage which aims to link entities that belong to a particular context for such heterogeneous data. Contextual linkage is challenging
because the unstructured part contains ambiguous entities (i.e., the
same entities may refer to different concepts); can evolve in time
and so do its entities; and contains noise (e.g., wrong, vandalized
or outdated entities). To address the problem of contextual linkage,
we introduce a novel data structure, called a ladder, which spans
contextually related entities from both the structured and unstructured parts as well as across time. We design and implement an
algorithm for ladder extraction and apply ladders to link contextually related entities. Finally, using four real datasets we show that
the proposed method outperforms the existing baselines in precision without sacrificing recall.
