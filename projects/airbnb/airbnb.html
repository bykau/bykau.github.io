<h1>Predict Next Destination for Airbnb Users</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data">Airbnb user dataset</a> (1.1GB)

<h2>Technologies & Algorithms</h2> 
python, pandas, matplotlib, xgboost, sklearn, ipython notebook, cross validation, grid search

<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this project I aim to predict in which country a new Airbnb user will make his
or her first booking. The dataset consists of a list of users along with their 
demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. I did an extensive
feature engineering based on the user session data as well as I tuned the xgboost model
using sklearn Randomized Search CV.

<h2>Results</h2>
The solution I proposed got into the top 10% at the Airbnb New User Bookings Kaggle Competition.
