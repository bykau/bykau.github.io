<h1>Mining Corporate History with the US Trademark dataset</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/electronic-data-products/trademark-case-files-dataset-0">Trademark Case Files Dataset</a> from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (1.79GB)

<h2>Technologies & Algorithms</h2> 
Java, MySQL, graphviz, data mining, dynamic programming, Steiner tree, RDF

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The project aims to extract the corporate history of all US companies based on the USPTO trademark dataset. 
If some change in ownership occurs the corresponding trademarks have to be 
re-registered accordingly. For instance, in the domain of
corporate mergers, acquisitions and spin-offs, one can observe how the intellectual property is
allocated among its owners throughout time. The United States Patent and Trademark Office
provides a set of trademarks along with the lists of their owners. By using the
reallocation of trademark I wrote a data mining algorithm which extracts 16K 
unique companies, 200K attributes along its evolution history. The evolution 
graphs are visualized with the GraphViz library.

<h2>Results</h2>
A number of extracted corporate histories are shown below (clickable).</br>
