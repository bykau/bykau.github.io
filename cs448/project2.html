<h1>Project 2: The RDBMS Lower-Level Layers</h1>
<font color="red">Due: Sunday, April 5, 11:59 pm</font><br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
This programming assignment (and subsequent programming assignments) should be carried out in <b>groups of two</b>. Choose a partner as soon as possible; you can Piazza or mail to <a href="mailto:manig@purdue.edu">Ganapathy Mani</a> and we will help you find a partner (<b>You can work and submit individually if you want to</b>).</br>

This project and those to come will be based on Minibase, a small relational DBMS, structured into several layers. In this project, you are required to implement parts of&nbsp;the lower-level layers: BM - the buffer 
manager layer and Layer HFPage - the </span>heap file layer. Layers should be tested and turned in separately.

<p>In this assignment, you will implement a simplified version of the Buffer 
Manager layer, without support for concurrency control or recovery. You will be 
given the code for the lower layer, the Disk Space Manager. </p>
<p>You should begin by reading the chapter on Disks and Files, especially 
section 9.4, to get an 
overview of buffer management. This material will also be covered in class. In 
addition, HTML documentation is available for Minibase. There is a link to the Minibase home page <font color="#0000FF"><b>
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/coral/minibase/minibase.html">here</a></b></font>. In particular, you should read the description of the DB class, 
which you will call extensively in this assignment. The Java documentation for 
the <em>diskmgr</em> package can be found <font color="#0000FF"><b>
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/courses/cs448/Projects/Project2/files/javadoc1/packages.html">here</a></b></font>. 
You should also read the code under diskmgr/ carefully to learn how package is 
declared and how Exceptions are handled in Minibase.</p>

into your own Unix local directory. The directory lib contains the jar file that 
implements the disk manager, you will use this file to compile your code. The 
content of the directory src is: </p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">under <em>bufmgr</em> directory <br>
	You should have all your code for <em>bufmgr</em> package implemented under 
	this directory. We provide a sample <em>Makefile</em> to compile your 
	project. You will have to set up any dependencies by editing this file. You 
	can also design your own Makefile. Whatever you do, please make sure that 
	the classpath is set to the one provided in the original Makefile. We also

<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The Buffer Manager Interface</span></b></span></p>
<p>The simplified Buffer Manager interface that you will implement in this 
assignment allows a client (a higher level program that calls the Buffer 
Manager) to allocate/de-allocate pages on disk, to bring a disk page into the 
buffer pool and pin it, and to unpin a page in the buffer pool. </p>
<p>The methods that you have to implement are described in the skeleton code <i>
BufMgr.java</i>. Find the file in "<font face="Courier New" size="2">project2part1/src/bufmgr/BufMgr.java</font>". 
<b>Read the 
method descriptions carefully and work on that file</b>.</p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="en-us"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">4. Internal Design</span></b></span></pre>
<p>The <em>buffer pool</em> is a collection of <em>frames</em> (page-sized 
sequence of main memory bytes) that is managed by the Buffer Manager. 
Conceptually, it should be stored as an array bufPool[numbuf] of Page objects. 
However, due to the limitation of Java language, it is not feasible to declare 
an array of Page objects and later on writing string (or other primitive values) 
to the defined Page. To get around the problem, we have defined our Page as an 
array of bytes and deal with buffer pool at the byte array level. Therefore, 
when implement your constructor for the BufMgr class, you should declare the 
buffer pool as <em>bufpool[numbuf][page_size]</em>. Note that the size of 
minibase pages is defined in the interface <em>GlobalConst</em> of the <em>
global</em> package. Before jump into coding, please make sure that you 
understand how Page object is defined and manipulated in Java minibase. </p>
<p>In addition, you should maintain an array bufDescr[numbuf] of <em>descriptors</em>, 
one per frame. Each descriptor is a record with the following fields: </p>
<blockquote>
	<font face="Courier New">
	<em>page number, pin_count, dirtybit</em>.</font> 
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The <em>pin_count</em> field is an integer, <em>page number</em> is a PageId 
object, and <em>dirtybit</em> is a boolean. This describes the page that is 
stored in the corresponding frame. A page is identified by a <em>page number</em> 
that is generated by the DB class when the page is allocated, and is unique over 
all pages in the database. The PageId type is defined as an integer type in 
<i>global</i> package.</font><p>A simple <em>hash table</em> should be used to figure out what frame a given 
disk page occupies. The hash table should be implemented (entirely in main 
memory) by using an array of pointers to lists of&nbsp; &lt;<em>page number, frame number</em>
&gt; 
pairs. The array is called the <em>directory</em> and each list of pairs is 
called a <em>bucket</em>. Given a <em>page number</em>, you should apply a <em>
hash function</em> to find the directory entry pointing to the bucket that 
contains the frame number for this page, if the page is in the buffer pool. If 
you search the bucket and don't find a pair containing this page number, the 
page is not in the pool. If you find such a pair, it will tell you the frame in 
which the page resides. This is illustrated in the next figure. </p>
<p><img src="/homes/sbykau/cs448/img3.gif" height="334" width="775" border="0"></p>
<p>The hash function must distribute values in the domain of the search field 
uniformly over the collection of buckets. If we have HTSIZE buckets, numbered 0 
through M-1, a hash function <i>h</i> of the form</p>
<p><i>h</i>(<i>value</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>a</i>*<i>value</i>+<i>b</i>)&nbsp;<i>mod</i>&nbsp;<i>HTSIZE</i></p>
<p>works well in practice. HTSIZE should be chosen to be a prime number. </p>
<p>When a page is requested the buffer manager should do the following: </p>
<dl compact="compact">
	<dt>1. </dt>
	<dd><font face="Times New Roman">Check the buffer pool (by using the hash table) to see if it contains 
	the requested page. If the page is not in the pool, it should be brought in 
	as follows: 
	</font> 
	<dl compact="compact">
		<dt><font face="Times New Roman">(a) </font> </dt>
		<dd><font face="Times New Roman">Choose a frame for replacement, using the 
		LRU replacement policy. 
		</font> 
		</dd>
		<dt><font face="Times New Roman">(b) </font> </dt>
		<dd><font face="Times New Roman">If the frame chosen for replacement is dirty, <em>flush</em> it 
		(i.e., write out the page that it contains to disk, using the 
		appropriate DB class method). 
		</font> 
		</dd>
		<dt><font face="Times New Roman">(c) </font> </dt>
		<dd><font face="Times New Roman">Read the requested page (again, by calling the DB class) into the 
		frame chosen for replacement; the <em>pin_count</em> and <em>dirtybit</em> 
		for the frame should be initialized to 0 and FALSE, respectively. 
		</font> 
		</dd>
		<dt><font face="Times New Roman">(d) </font> </dt>
		<dd><font face="Times New Roman">Delete the entry for the old page from the Buffer Manager's hash 
		table and insert an entry for the new page. Also, update the entry for 
		this frame in the bufDescr array to reflect these changes. </font> </dd>
	</dl>
	</dd>
	<dt><font face="Times New Roman">2. </font> </dt>
	<dd><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Pin</em> the requested page by incrementing the <em>pin_count</em> 
	in the descriptor for this frame. and return a pointer to the page to the 
	requestor. </font> </dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>The LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy </strong><br>
  To implement the LRU replacement policy, maintain a queue of frame numbers (of 
the frames with <i>pin_count</i> 0). When a frame is to be chosen for 
replacement, you should pick the first frame in this list. A frame number is 
added to the end of the queue when the <em>pin_count</em> for the frame is 
decremented to 0. A frame number is removed from the queue if the <em>pin_count</em> 
becomes non-zero: this could happen if there is a request for the page currently 
in the frame! <br>
</p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 16pt" lang="en-us"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">5. Error protocol</span></b></span></pre>
<p>Though the Throwable class in Java contains a snapshot of the execution stack 
of its thread at the time it was created and also a message string that gives 
more information about the error (exception), we have decided to maintain a copy 
of our own stack to have more control over the error handling. </p>
<p>We provide the <em>chainexception</em> package to handle the Minibase 
exception stack. Every exception created in your <em>bufmgr</em> package should 
extend the ChainException class. The exceptions are thrown according to the 
following rule: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Error caused by an exception 
	caused by another layer: </p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3">For example: (when try to pin page 
	from diskmgr layer)</font><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="2"><br></font>
	<font face="Courier New" size="2">try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SystemDefs.JavabaseBM.pinPage(pageId, page, true);<br>}<br>catch (Exception e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new DiskMgrException(e, "DB.java: pinPage() failed");<br>}</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Error not caused by exceptions of 
	others, but needs to be acknowledged:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font size="3">For example: (when try to unpin a 
	page that is not pinned)</font><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="2"><br>
	</font>
	<font face="Courier New" size="2">if (pin_count == 0) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new PageUnpinnedException (null, "BUFMGR: 
	PAGE_NOT_PINNED.");<br>
	}</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the ChainException class keeps track of all the exceptions thrown 
across the different layers. Any exceptions that you decide to throw in your
<em>bufmgr</em> package should extend the ChainException class. <br>
For testing purposes, we ask you to throw the following exceptions in case of 
error (use the exact same name, please): </p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">BufferPoolExceededException <br>
	Throw a BufferPoolExceededException when try to pin a page to the buffer 
	pool with no unpinned frame left. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">PagePinnedException <br>
	Throw a PagePinnedException when try to free a page that is still pinned.
	</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">HashEntryNotFoundException <br>
	Throw a HashEntryNotFoundException when page specified by PageId is not 
	found in the buffer pool. </font></li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to throw other new exceptions as you see fit. But make sure that 
you follow the error protocol when you catch an exception. Also, think carefully 
about what else you need to do in the <em>catch</em> phase. Sometimes you do 
need to unroll the previous operations when failure happens. </p>

<p>In this part, you will implement the Heap file layer. You will be given the 
documentation for the lower layers (Buffer Manager and Disk Space Manager), as 
well as the documents for managing records on a Heap file page. You can find the 
package index for the above <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/courses/cs448/Projects/Project2/files/javadoc2/packages.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>This assignment has three parts. You have to do the following: </p>
<dl compact="compact">
	<dt>1. </dt>
	<dd><font face="Times New Roman">Familiarize yourself with the Heap file, 
	HFPage, Buffer Manager and Disk Space Manager interfaces. </font></dd>
	<dt><font face="Times New Roman">2. </font></dt>
	<dd><font face="Times New Roman">Implement the Heap file class. You can 
	ignore concurrency control and recovery issues, and concentrate on 
	implementing the interface routines. You should deal with free space 
	intelligently, using either a linked list or page directory to identify 
	pages with room for records. When a record is deleted, you must update your 
	information about available free space, and when a record is inserted, you 
	must try to use free space on existing pages before allocating a new page.
